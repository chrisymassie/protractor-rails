# Protractor::Rails

This gem helps you to not go through the same pain that I did trying to figure out the best way to run angularjs e2e tests in a rails application.

NB: This gem is in pre-release so don't use it yet.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'protractor-rails'
